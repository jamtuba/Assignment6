To run the Blazor client and Azure Function, you'll need to run the following two commands in separate consoles/terminals:

At the root folder run: 
	dotnet run --project Assignment6
At the Api folder run: 
	func start --cors "https://localhost:5001,http://localhost:5000"

The --cors argument is required to allow communication between localhost:5001 or localhost:5000 and the Azure Function at localhost:7071.
